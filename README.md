**üìà Project on impact of news on the stock market**
 
 - [Idea](#idea)
 - [Task](#task)

## Idea
  The behavior of investors in the stock market depends on various factors:
  - State of the world economy
  - Macroeconomic indicators of the resident country
  - Financial income of individual companies
  - News of the country, which is interesting for the investor, etc.

If we have data on these factors, it becomes possible to predict the reaction of investors to change. Therefore, if in the reporting period the planned indicators of the company are not met, the quotes of the shares of this company will decrease. **A positive example**: the reduction of the key rate of the Central Bank increases the interest of investors in shares, which increases the likelihood of growth in stock quotes.

The data of economic indicators are in the public domain, and we can easily get them for analysis. However, the news is not so simple, because there is no generally accepted source of information and values for assessing the impact of news on the stock market.

**The idea of the project is** to create a database of news publications with a view rate to show how people's reaction to news correlates with stock market movements.
